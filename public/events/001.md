The Union intercepted HA communication two weeks ago about them finding something on the planet **Rafvas 38-J**. on our scanners we spotted a massive blast of energy being discharged at a Harrison testing facility. This is when a lancer with the callsign **PHANTOM** was dispatched to infiltrate the nearby settlement Heritage then gain access to the facility and put a stop to it. Shortly after he made his way to the facility he relayed on comms that he stole a important system to their operation after that we lost all communication and imagery with him. When our communications came back online the lancer was no where to be seen and the facility looked destroyed with the wildlife over taking it I will send (group name) there to retrace his steps and find out what happened recover **PHANTOM's** body with whatever tech he stole. Grab it before Harrison gets there hands on it
