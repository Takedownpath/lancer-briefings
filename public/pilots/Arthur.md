Family relations to others on Taiga-3, including one or more Mechanized Chassis Pilots. close ties to non-related pilot Mehro-Tepre Sunoaten, and possibly a religious convert due to said pilot. Pilots share good chemistry on and off the field. Has a history of Cargo-Running as a pilot before joining Albatross ranks. Unlikely yet possible to be a deserter, later accepted back on station on unknown circumstances. Suspected travel partner for Mehro-Tepre, and likely the one to bring him to Albatross.
