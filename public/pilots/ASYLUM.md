Cool this actually works. Sooooo the Union actually knows like nothing about me it would seem, but that makes sense. Giving you a basic rundown, I'm a bit of an anomaly. I have the pleasure of being off the grid when it comes to the union, I like to think its an accomplishment, but it makes dossiers like this a little hard. I did actually graduate from Ras Shamra Academy, they got that right, but they seem to be missing the really juicy details about my time there. During my training I racked up quite the reputation for "insubordination", but it was just some plain old tomfoolery. The other students in my class were fond of my tricks I pulled, editing training hours, disabling protocols on comp/cons and many more. I only graduated because of a bet I made with the Drill Sargent at the time. He lost, I graduated, simple as. Oh and the weight situation, It's a story ill leave to fully explain if you ask, but in short, I'm a bit gravity deficient due to an accident a few years ago.  I tell you all of this to sort of warn you, I will not fight like anything you've fought with or against before, I can guarantee that. See you on the ship :).
