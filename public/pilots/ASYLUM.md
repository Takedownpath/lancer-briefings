**NOTES**

Weiss Alison, callsign Asylum, joined the Union Pilot Dossier at age 25, graduating from the Ras Shamra Pilot Academy in the middle of her class. Assigned to low level anti-piracy operations, her tactics often involved direct assault and attrition tactics. Psychological Evaluation showed interesting results, Weiss showed little interest in day to day activity, instead only showing real excitement in either life-threatening, or stressful environs. There is not much data on her on-goings before acquiring her Pilot License, with civilian records showing no data that match her name, history, or biometrics. This leads us to believe she is utilizing an alias, though even through massive data combing efforts across the omninet, no data was found on her pre-enlistment.

Cool this actually works. Sooooo the Union actually knows like nothing about me it would seem, but that makes sense. Giving you a basic rundown, I'm a bit of an anomaly. I have the pleasure of being off the grid when it comes to the union, I like to think its an accomplishment, but it makes dossiers like this a little hard. I did actually graduate from Ras Shamra Academy, they got that right, but they seem to be missing the really juicy details about my time there. During my training I racked up quite the reputation for "insubordination", but it was just some plain old tomfoolery. The other students in my class were fond of my tricks I pulled, editing training hours, disabling protocols on comp/cons and many more. I only graduated because of a bet I made with the Drill Sargent at the time. He lost, I graduated, simple as. Oh and the weight situation, It's a story ill leave to fully explain if you ask, but in short, I'm a bit gravity deficient due to an accident a few years ago. I tell you all of this to sort of warn you, I will not fight like anything you've fought with or against before, I can guarantee that. See you on the ship ðŸ˜ƒ.
